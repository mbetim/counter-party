# Counter party

Let's say that you're going to an all-you-can-eat pizza restaurant with your friends. Wouldn't you like to count how many slices each one ate?

Well, this is the idea that made me start this side-project. I know that it's not a million-dollar idea, but it's a good one to put some skill into practice like:

- Working with WebSocket in [Next](https://nextjs.org/) and [Nest](https://nestjs.com/)
- Merging projects into a monorepo (initially, the web and server were different repos)
- Managing a monorepo (with [yarn workspace](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/))
- Deploying it in different platforms
- And many more.

The app hasn't been deployed yet, but I'll update the README as soon as it's out.

I also have some other ideas in mind that I'll be implementing with time.
